To compile the source files with gcc you can use the following command in the main folder to create the executable

```
gcc main.c Headers/cmdhelper.c Headers/kernel.c Headers/ppmio.c Headers/ppmmod.c Headers/segedfvk.c -o dgedit.exe
```

To use the program you have to call it from the command with the arguments.
